## Hi there, I'm Felipe!

I am very interested in leveraging data to solve challenges.

- 💻 I mostly use Python and its packages (such as [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/))
- 📈 I also wrote a package for transforming Time Series to a tabular format for Neural Networks: [tabular-time-series](https://github.com/felipewhitaker/tabular-time-series)
- 👓 I learned  Julia during my Masters for optimization challenges and fell in love with it. Check out [Decision and Risk Analysis repo](https://github.com/felipewhitaker/decision_and_risk_analysis).
- 🌱 I love learning new concepts and contexts through challengeds
- 💬 Ping me for any data related challenge and I will love listening about it!
- ❤️ Fun fact: I love 🎶 music and 🚴 cycling!

### 🎓 Education

I'm an Operations Research Master student at the [Industrial Engineering Department](http://www.ind.puc-rio.br/en/) of [PUC-Rio](https://www.puc-rio.br/index.html) where also completed my BsC in Industrial Engineering with minor in Risk Analysis.
 
### 💼 Experience 

Currently I am at [Gympass](https://site.gympass.com/) automating processes. Before that I have had experiences with Data Science and applied Machine Learning, and you can check it on my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/felipe-whitaker) profile.
